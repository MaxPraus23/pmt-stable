# Power Measurement Toolkit (PMT) Releases

This repository contains releases of the Power Measurement Toolkit (PMT), a
comprehensive toolkit for power measurement and monitoring. Below are details
for each release:

## Unreleased

### Added:

- `pmt::Create` interface that accepts the platform as a string
- `pmt::NVIDIA` that automatically dispatches either `NVML` or `Tegra`
- Support to include PMT in another CMake project using `FetchContent` (see
  `example`)
- Add Likwid support based on performance groups (thanks @markbuettner!)

### Changed:

- The CMake options are prefixed with `PMT_`, rather than having it as `_PMT`
  suffix
- Simpler CMake code for `ROCM`
- The Python interface uses the new `pmt::Create` interface

## 1.2.0

### Changelog:

- Major refactoring + cleanup throughout (both in the library and in CMake)
